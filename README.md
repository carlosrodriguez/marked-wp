marked-wp
==================

A couple of node scripts based on [Scott's Gonzalez](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress) grunt wordpress script which allows you to post to wordpress from local Markdown files.

The ida of this script is to be able to sync different WordPress blogs (think dev, prodcution) by simply writing all content locally. You can also use Github Webhooks to store your posts and post them to one or more WordPress locations.

## TODO
* Set instructions
* Fix upload path
* Test post modify
* Test multiple servers
